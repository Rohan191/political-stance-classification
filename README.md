A Politician’s words often reveal their political ideology. Politicians often use Twitter to express their beliefs, stances on current political issues, and reactions concerning national and international events. Indian politicians nowadays very active on Twitter. Thus is becomes an important work to analyze their twitter activity to get to know more about their stance on various issues. 


In this project, we build a model to predict the stance of Indian politicians on various issues based on their tweets. The existing work in this area has been done on U.S. politicians. This is a first of it’s kind political bias prediction on Indian politicians. 

Also, as their is no proper labeled dataset for Indian politicians, we build a new dataset to predict issue as well as stance on a new tweet. The dataset is a labelled English dataset of ~8500 tweets of 150 Indian politicians on 24 recent issues.

We do this using a multi-head classification model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Our results show that our model performs similar to existing work but on a relatively smaller dataset.
